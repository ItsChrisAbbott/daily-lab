# learning-python 📚🖥️

A living notebook of everything I code while leveling up from IT support
tech → Python backend developer → Georgia Tech OMSCS student → ML Engineer.  
Contents grow daily: CS50 problem-sets in C/Python, “Automate the Boring
Stuff” scripts, LeetCode solutions, Flask mini-apps, and notes on each new
concept I master.
